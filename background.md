In this simulation, a 2027 space expedition to an uncharted exoplanet results in the accidental return of a novel and highly lethal pathogen. Upon returning to Earth, astronauts unknowingly released a parasitic organism by contact during post-mission analysis of extraterrestrial samples. The organism, a cholera-like parasite with advanced resilience, has a 3-day incubation period before manifesting symptoms.
Initially resembling a common cold, the infection rapidly escalates, causing respiratory issues, severe diarrhea, plague-like boils, and extreme dehydration. Infected individuals may require up to 10 gallons of water per day. This demand places a critical strain on local water supplies. The parasite reproduces asexually, remains highly contagious even after host death, and can jump between hosts with alarming efficiency.
The CDC has traced the outbreak to Blacksburg, Virginia, now under full quarantine. The outbreak occurred in Blacksburg because the astronauts came to VT to give a post-voyage speech, and Blacksburg was the first place they visited for post-sample analysis. The talk was on a Wednesday, and after its completion, the astronauts reported their symptoms to the Carilion Medical Clinic. Contact tracing began shortly after, since Carillion was unable to identify the disease beyond its similar characteristics to cholera. The organism's durability and mutation rate pose a severe threat to biosecurity and public infrastructure. This simulation explores the catastrophic consequences of disease spread, the vulnerabilities in our biological defense systems, and the urgent need for containment protocols in future space exploration missions.
