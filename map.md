# Cattail Crisis Map

### This is an amazing map created to help you understand where events take place relative to other events for the **Cattail Crisis Simulation**!
### 

### You'll look at the map, see a specific event within each phase, go to the Scenarios Tab --> Phase X Events --> leave a comment! 
### 

### This comment is your report based on your role in the simulation. Your comment title should include the **specific event** you are responding to! Ex: Phase 2.3, CDC Initial Response 
### 

### Red Team will throw curveballs for each phase, expect 2-3 Red Team events per phase! You can find Red Team's events for each phase as they come when you go to the Scenarios Tab --> Phase X Events
### 

## Now flex those integrated security muscles and **let's mitigate this crisis**!
