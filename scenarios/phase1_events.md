# Events in the phase:  

## Phase 1: Initial Infection
###   1.1 Astronauts give a talk at Virginia Tech and parasite/disease begins to spread on Wednesday, February 15th, 2027. 
    
###   1.2 All those who attended the meet and greet session and were in contact with the Astronauts were infected on this Wednesday

###   1.3 Symptoms begin presenting on Friday, February 18th. Schiffert is closed on the weekends, as are a few popular clinics in the area. Lewis-Gale Montgomery Hospital (LGMH) is the main option for severely affected patients. Local authorities are instituting a shelter in place protocol given the rapidness of disease spread

###   1.4 LGMH becomes overwhelmed with affected patients. Some of the student/faculty workers at LGMH attended the astronaut talk and were in direct contact with the infected astronauts.
