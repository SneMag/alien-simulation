## Your current phase is: Phase 1
### Phase Description

### Phase 1: Initial Infection 
      
On Wednesday, February 15th, 2027, astronauts visited Virginia Tech, and a rapidly spreading parasite or disease began infecting attendees of the meet and greet session. Symptoms emerged by Friday, February 18th, but with Schiffert and several local clinics closed over the weekend, Lewis-Gale Montgomery Hospital (LGMH) became the primary care center and was quickly overwhelmed. As some LGMH staff had also attended the event and were infected, local authorities instituted a shelter-in-place protocol to contain the outbreak.
