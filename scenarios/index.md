### Phase Description

### Phase 1: Initial Infection 
      
On Saturday, February 19th, a power outage at Lewis-Gale Montgomery Hospital (LGMH) worsened the crisis as resources dwindled, prompting the Virginia Governor to request emergency supplies for the region. By Monday, February 21st, after growing public pressure and concern from parents, university leaders were forced to consider action while the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) launched an official inquiry. On Tuesday, February 22nd, the VDH publicly confirmed that Blacksburg’s waterways were contaminated and linked the parasite—now named "Cattail" due to its resemblance to cattail weed and cholera—to the astronaut event, with two deaths and over 70 confirmed infections; meanwhile, private findings warned of 300 more potential cases and escalating contamination of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.
