# Scenarios
 
## Your current phase is: Phase 1

### Phase 1: Initial Infection       
A group of astronauts infected with an aliean parasite arrive at Virginia Tech to give a presentation. The parasite begins to spread, prompting shelter-in-place orders from local authorities as Lewis-Gale Montgomery Hospital (LGMH) becomes overwhelmed with patients.

<!-- ### Phase 2: Early Crisis
On Saturday, February 19th, a power outage at LGMH worsened the crisis as resources dwindled, prompting the Virginia Governor to request emergency supplies for the region. By Monday, February 21st, after growing public pressure and concern from parents, university leaders were forced to consider action while the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) launched an official inquiry. On Tuesday, February 22nd, the VDH publicly confirmed that Blacksburg’s waterways were contaminated and linked the parasite—now named "Cattail" due to its resemblance to cattail weed and cholera—to the astronaut event, with two deaths and over 70 confirmed infections; meanwhile, private findings warned of 300 more potential cases and escalating contamination of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. -->

<!-- ### Phase 3: CDC Arrival and Community Division
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) responds to the situation and begins experimenting with treatment techniques for the parasite. Disinformation and misinformation spread about the CDC's response. -->

<!-- ### Phase 4: Human Trials and Escalating Controversy
The first wave of trials concludes, though debate continues over university restrictions in response to the outbreak. The infected population is stabilizing, signifying the final phase of the simulation. -->
