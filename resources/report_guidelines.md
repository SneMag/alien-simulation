# Report Guidelines

## Blue Team
Each Blue Team participant should submit a report summarizing their response to each phase. This report should include:

- A brief description of their role’s response to each development in the phase’s timeline (if one is necessary for that role).
- A description of how the participant interacted with other members of the Blue Team. If multiple students collaborated to respond to one of the developments in the phase, their reports should include a description of how they collaborated and contributed their role’s resources to their solution.
- A brief summary of the current state of the simulation from their role’s perspective. What resources do they need? Do they have control of the situation, or do they need help? What are the most imminent risks to their role? What are their immediate next steps?

Additionally, each member of the Blue Team should submit a brief report responding to the scenarios created by the Red Team. This can include:

- How their role reacted to the Red Team’s new event.
- Whether there are any lasting consequences from their role’s perspective. What new risks are they vulnerable to after this event? Were they able - to successfully solve the problems presented by the Red Team?

In total, each member of the Blue Team should submit one report per phase and one report per Red Team injection.

## Red Team
At the end of each phase, each member of the Red Team will write an After Action Report evaluating the Blue Team's response to the events they created. These reports will provide brief qualitative and quantitative feedback for the Blue Team on each evaluation metric. See the **Evaluation Metrics** section for an overview of the these metrics and an explanation of how the After Action Reports should quantitatively score them.
