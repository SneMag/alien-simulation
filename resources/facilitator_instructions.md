# Facilitator Instructions

The facilitator should introduce the simulation by:

- Introducing all the participants to their individual roles first. Participants can choose their roles, or they can be assigned. 
- Giving the participants a research assignment to familiarize them with their roles and to give them time to plan how they would react to an emergency.
- Dividing the participants into the following groups based on their roles. An asterisk (*) indicates that participants in this role will likely cycle around to interact with different groups over the course of the simulation.
    - **Government Health & Emergency Response**
        - Commissioner of VDH, *Governor of Virginia, CEO of Lewis Gale Medical Center, Doctor, Nurse, Director of the Office of Pandemics and Emerging Threats, *Acting Director of the CDC, Director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the CDC
    - **University & Campus Response**
        - *University President, University Vice President (Chief Operating Officer), *Director of Schiffert Health Center, University Legal Counsel, *Chief of the Police Department, *Police Officer #1, *Police Officer #2
    - **Blacksburg Community**
        - Student #1, Student #2, Professor #1, Professor #2, Townee #1, Townee #2
    - **Red Team**
        - Astronaut Representative (From X-Spacer), Disinformer, Local Business Representatives (price-gouger reps), Angry Parents Representative
- Allowing the participants to meet with their groups and discuss how they will work together.

The facilitator can handle the participants’ questions using the following guidelines:

- If participant questions are easily answered by re-reading the summary of the simulation/events in the simulation, direct them to the summary of the event
- If participant questions are beyond the scope of the simulation, do not discourage creativity. Inform the Red Team of new ideas that they can use to make more events. If limited on time, shut down the scope creep.
- Refer, to the best of your ability, to the Q&A section of the User Manual. If situations don’t line up perfectly, that’s okay! Just do your best to align the circumstances. 

The facilitator can steer the events in the simulation using the following guidelines:

- If Red Team events are too complex and beyond the scope of the simulation, the facilitator has the power to end/reverse events.
- If Red Team events are too easy, then the facilitator has the power to add events of their choosing into the simulation.
- If participants are seemingly stuck on an event/issue/how to manage a particular crisis, inject guidance/additional information.
