    Misinformation that zinc supplementation doesn’t work begins to spread online
    Fake at-home therapies like eating excessive amounts of oranges, taking castor oil, eating supplements, drinking mouthwash, etc. spread
    The right-wing Blacksburg community states that zinc supplementation in public school restricts individual liberty among parents
