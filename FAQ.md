# FAQs and Troubleshooting


A section addressing potential questions or challenges that participants or facilitators may encounter during the simulation, along with suggested solutions.

### Potential Challenges

- **Students may get stuck/not know what to do next during the simulation**  
  - To combat this, the Red Team speaks about what the students have done well and what needs to be improved. This will allow students to understand what direction they may want to take the simulation in.

- **At the beginning of the simulation, students may not want to collaborate with other groups or members in their group**  
  - Outline the metrics for the students and provide examples of how groups may work together. Having students sit in groups will facilitate cooperation within teams, but encourage one student per group to be the representative to talk to other groups to ensure collaboration.

- **Students struggle to understand the importance of the simulation since it is based on a fictional story**  
  - Use examples of pandemics that students have lived through, such as COVID-19. Explain to students how disease pandemics can affect lives and are a real-world problem.

### Suggested Solutions / Possible Mitigations

- Ensure that the simulation is set up in groups and teams to keep it dynamic and encourage collaboration between the roles.
- Explain the real-world consequences of a disease outbreak to demonstrate the importance of the simulation.
- Change the simulation as needed to best fit the curriculum and size of the class.
