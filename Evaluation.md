# Evaluation Metrics 
**Clear criteria for evaluating participant performance, such as their decision-making process, collaboration, and achievement of objectives.**
 
The Red Team and Professor will be responsible for evaluating and providing feedback to simulation participants. Each student will write an After Action Report, which will provide the qualitative feedback and evaluation metrics. 
- **Casualty Management:** This will be measured by tracking casualties.  
    -   Minimizing casualties. 
    -   Identify casualties
    -   Informing loved ones of casualties
    - Organizing safe return of bodies to loved ones
- **Parasite Containment:** This will be measured by tracking how many people are infected with the parasite  
    - Contain parasite spread
    - Provide reliable information about parasite and spread
    - Combat disinformation about parasite
    - Rapid vaccine creation procedures 
    - Provide reliable information about the vaccine and its contents as well as how it will stop the spread
    - Combat vaccine disinformation
- **Communication and Collaboration:** Red Team will score the class on a 1 to 10 scale of how effective they believe communication and collaboration was at the end of each day and the score will be averaged.  
    - Effective, strong, frequent, and composed communication 
    - Timely + accurate Responses
    - Cohesive interoperability among various parties 
    - Initiative is taken by every simulant to resolve issues BEFORE they occur if possible. Simulants do not wait until disaster strikes to collaborate/solve problems. 
- **Reduction of human security violations:** Red Team will score class on a 1 to 10 scale of how well they believe students responded to events and placed human security as a priority throughout the day. The data will be averaged over the number of simulation days.  
    - Minimizing human security violations
    - Identify vulnerable groups 
    - Ensure that vulnerable groups get the health resources they need
    - Minimizing reactive violence
    - Condemning publicly any human security violations that occur in the simulation by simulants/events that Red Team creates
